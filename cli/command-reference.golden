The Ringboard (clipboard history) CLI.

Ringboard uses a client-server architecture, wherein the server has exclusive write access to the
clipboard database and clients must ask the server to perform the modifications they need. This CLI
is a non-interactive client and a debugging tool.

Usage: clipboard-history <COMMAND>

Commands:
  get              Get an entry from the database
  search           Searches the Ringboard database for entries matching a query
  add              Add an entry to the database
  favorite         Favorite an entry
  unfavorite       Unfavorite an entry
  move-to-front    Move an entry to the front, making it the most recent entry
  swap             Swap the positions of two entries
  remove           Delete an entry from the database
  wipe             Wipe the entire database
  import           Migrate from other clipboard managers to Ringboard
  garbage-collect  Run garbage collection on the database
  configure        Modify app settings

  <QUERY>
          The query string to search for

Options:
  -r, --regex
          Interpret the query string as regex instead of a plain-text match

Swap the positions of two entries.

One of the entries may be uninitialized. Thus, swap can be used to insert an entry into the ring by

deleting the swapped out entry.

Edit the X11 watcher settings

Usage: clipboard-history configure x11 [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --auto-paste <AUTO_PASTE>
          Instead of simply placing selected items in the clipboard, attempt to automatically paste
          the selected item into the previously focused application
          
          [possible values: true, false]

      --fast-path-optimizations <FAST_PATH_OPTIMIZATIONS>
          Disable this option to support blocking passwords from password managers that support the
          `x-kde-passwordManagerHint` mime type.
          
          ### Technical details
          
          In X11, it is possible to ask applications for their selection with a mime type before
          knowing if the selection is available in that format. Since the majority of clipboard
          entries are expected to be text based, Ringboard skips a round trip with the application
          by immediately asking for a plain text mime type selection. Only if this request fails
          will Ringboard ask the application for the supported mime types on its selection.
          
          [possible values: true, false]

  -h, --help

          the selected item into the previously focused application
          
          [possible values: true, false]

Debugging tools for developers

Usage: clipboard-history debug <COMMAND>

Commands:
  stats     Print statistics about the Ringboard database
  dump      Dump the database contents for analysis
  generate  Generate a pseudo-random database for testing and performance tuning purposes
  fuzz      Spam the server with random commands
  help      Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help

Print statistics about the Ringboard database

Usage: clipboard-history debug stats

Options:
  -h, --help
          Print help (use `-h` for a summary)

---

Dump the database contents for analysis.

The JSON format is as follows: 
[ 
  { 
    "id": int64, 
    "kind": "Human" | "Bytes", 
    "data": (UTF-8 | base64) string 
  }, 
  ... 
]

Note that `$ ringboard import json` expects a JSON stream (wherein each object appears on its own
line instead of being in a list). To import an export, you can convert the JSON array to a stream
with `$ ... | jq -c .[]`.
